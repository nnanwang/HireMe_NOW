## Setup

 To setup enrironment for this website app, you need to perpare the following tools: shell, [conda/miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).  With conda/miniconda, we would be convinent to manage our python versions.

### Shell
In shell (which is already in your computer!), we can use conda/miniconda, install pacages, and run our website. All of them will be very helpful for this project.


#### Usage

If you are a **Windows** user, you need to tape **'win+R'** on your keyboard, and then type **'cmd'**, so that you will get your shell.


If you are a **Mac** user, you need to tape **'Command+space'** on your keyboard, and then enter **'terminal'**, so that you will get your shell.

PS: Feel free to use another shell tools, they should all works well.

### Conda

When you get ready on your shell, then you can install your conda/miniconda on your computer. Conda is a useful tool which integrate many platform such as: Jupyter notebook, Pycharm, ect. However, I would highly recommanded you just install **miniconda**. This is because if you don't need that much platforms (At least I don't need so much), then miniconda will **save you a lot of spaces**. At the same time, it's also **effectively enough for us to manage our python environments**, which is the main target for us to use in this project. Therefore, here I just put how to install miniconda for your computer.

#### Installation

If you are a windows user, you can download it [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#windows-installers). Just download the installer and click 'next' would be fine. Please check your computer to make sure it's 32 bit or 64 bit.

If you are a Mac user, you can download it [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#macos-installers). Just download the .pkg file and click 'next' would be fine.

Check your miniconda in your shell:
```
conda --version
```
You should get result like (Depending on the version of your conda):
```
conda 4.14.0
```

### Python version

Now we are ready for manage our python version. The python version we used in this project is python 3.11. And all the pacages we used is in [env.yml](##env.yml). The followings is the details about how to setup a suitable python environment for this project.

First, open your shell (see [Shell](#shell) for details). Then, git clone our project to your location by:
```
git clone https://github.com/nnanwang/HireMe_NOW.git
```
Then, change your shell location to your project:
```
cd project-location
```
Use conda to create an environment for this project:
```
conda create
```
