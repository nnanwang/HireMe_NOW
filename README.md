## Setup Envrionment

To totally run this code, you need: 

- Setup necessary system environment 
- Setup suitable Python version (including special packages)

---

### 1. Setup necessary system environment
 To setup enrironment for this website app, you need to perpare the following tools: `shell`, [conda/miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).  
 
 - With `shell` (which is already in your computer!), we can use conda/miniconda, install pacages, and run our website. 
 
 - With `conda/miniconda`, we would be convinent to manage our python versions. Conda is a useful tool which integrate many platform such as: Jupyter notebook, Pycharm, ect. However, I would highly recommanded you just install **miniconda**. This is because if you don't need that much platforms (At least I don't need so much), then miniconda will **save you a lot of spaces**. At the same time, it's also **effectively enough for us to manage our python environments**, which is the main target for us to use in this project. Therefore, here I just put how to install miniconda for your computer.

PS: Here I provided one method of how to use shell and miniconda. Feel free to use another shell tools or conda, they should work well.

If you are a **Windows** user:
 
  1.  Open your shell. You need to tape **'win+R'** on your keyboard, and then type **'cmd'**, so that you will get your shell.

  2. Download [miniconda - for windows](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#windows-installers). Just download the installer and click 'next' would be fine. Please check your computer to make sure it's 32 bit or 64 bit.


If you are a **Mac** user:

  1. Open your shell. You need to tape **'Command+space'** on your keyboard, and then enter **'terminal'**, so that you will get your shell.

  2. Download [miniconda - for mac](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#macos-installers). Just download the .pkg file and click 'next' would be fine.


Check if your miniconda works well in your shell:
```
(base) PS YourUserLocation> conda --version  ## Type "conda --version" in your shell.
conda 22.11.1                                ## You should get result like (Depending on the version of your conda)
```


### 2. Setup suitable Python version

The python version we used in this project is python 3.11. And all the pacages we used is in [requirements.txt](##env.yml). The followings is the details about how to setup a suitable python environment for this project.

First, open your shell (See details in [previous](#1-setup-necessary-system-environment)). Then, git clone our project to your location by:
```
git clone https://github.com/nnanwang/HireMe_NOW.git
```
Then, change your shell location to your project:
```
cd project-location
```
After that, use conda to create an environment for this project:
```
conda create -n hire_me_now python=3.11
``` 
Then, we have an environment which calls 'hire_me_now', we need to activate this environment first, and install the pacages we need:
```
conda activate hire_me_now    # you should see the env name in the brackets changed from 'base' to 'hire_me_now'
pip install -r requirements.txt    # install packages we need
```

Now you are ready to develop this project (Yeah!)

## Develop Project

When you want to develop this project, and run this project, you need to go to hmn_project ([here](#folder-stucture) is the folders structure), and then 
```
cd <hmn_project>   # go to this folder
python manage.py runserver
```
This website should be run on your computer.

Several useful files you should know for developing this project:
| File | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [views.py](##hmn_project/hire_me_now/views.py) | [HireMe_NOW/hmn_project/hire_me_now](##hmn_project/hire_me_now) | |
| [urls.py (hire_me_now)](##hmn_project/hire_me_now/urls.py) | [HireMe_NOW/hmn_project/hire_me_now](##hmn_project/hire_me_now) | |
| [urls.py (hmn_project)](##hmn_project/hmn_project/urls.py) | [HireMe_NOW/hmn_project](##hmn_project/hmn_project) | |
| [settings.py](##hmn_project/hmn_project/settings.py) | [HireMe_NOW/hmn_project](##hmn_project/hmn_project) | |
| [OpenaiAPIKey.py](##hmn_project/hire_me_now/secret/OpenaiAPIKey.py)| [HireMe_NOW/hmn_project/hire_me_now/secret](##hmn_project/hire_me_now/secret) | This is the file for you to put your OpenaiAPIKey, and make sure it wouldn't leak to website(See [details](#openaiapikey)). |
| **PS: Website screens are all in templates folder** |||
